This repository represents a portable bash framework usable on our local HPC infrastructure. For the purpose of documenting our research workflows we made it openly available. The framework combines reproducible image processing based on preconfigured and custom container-based neuroimaging pipelines as well as internal data management standards. To facilitate dataset handling right from the image acquisition we, furthermore, provide a collection of helper functions - e.g. for dataset setup or quantification of missing data.
