This repository represents a portable bash framework usable on the local HPC infrastructure of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. For the purpose of documenting our research workflows we made it openly available. The framework combines reproducible image processing based on preconfigured and custom container-based neuroimaging pipelines, easy upscaling via SLURM as well as internal data management standards. To facilitate dataset handling right from the image acquisition, we, furthermore, provide a collection of helper functions - e.g. for dataset setup or quantification of missing data. Please refer to the [repository wiki](https://github.com/csi-hamburg/CSIframe/wiki) for further details and pipeline documentation
